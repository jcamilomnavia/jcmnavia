              I am a person always interested in learning and improving myself
              in every way. I'm passionate in what I do and always give my best
              no matter what.

              I've been always into computers and stuff (oh, I did... explore
              into some computers - Yes, I broke them 😅). I really believe in
              self-taught learning, that's why even since I started the
              university, I took the knowledge to the next level and put into
              real world situations, getting that extra experience that gave me
              a boost. Now I'm proud to say that I've become a great developer,
              I've so much to offer and still so much to learn. My journey
              started at 17th years-old and I don't expect it to end soon, on
              the contrary, here I am looking for challenges!

              I also love reading books -- don't tell me you don't like Harry
              Potter 🫣, I love practicing tennis 🎾, I'm a photographer when I
              have the chance 📸 and... yeah, I think that's it. Ah, I also like
              to paint 🎨.

              Feel free to reach me out to discuss something, grab a coffee,
              play tennis, develop that amazing idea you have, anything, really!
